# void-templates

A repository for me to mess around with void packaging and templates.

Currently working on getting different Window Maker dock apps ported to templates.

**What I've ported:**
- *libdockapp*

I haven't created any of these dock apps, I am only simply porting them to void templates.

if you have any questions contact the maintainer (me) here: nmplaceholder@protonmail.com
