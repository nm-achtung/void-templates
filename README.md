# void-templates

A repository for me to mess around with void packaging and templates.

Currently working on getting different Window Maker dock apps ported to templates.

What I've ported: 
- libdockapp

What I want to port:
- AlsaMixer.app
- asmon
- cputnik
- wmcpufreq
- wmsystemtray

I haven't created any of these dock apps, I am only simply porting them to void templates.
